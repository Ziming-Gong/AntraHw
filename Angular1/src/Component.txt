                     handle the logic:
                     it will pass the data to the template
                     it will handle the events occurred in the template 
                     it will receive data from the template 

                     Angular supports two way bindings:
                        1 way binding concepts
                            1.1 passing data from component to template
                                1.1.1 use interpolation {{}}
                                1.1.2 use property binding []  
                                    mainly for some case that do not have closed tag. eg. <input>
                        

                            1.2 pass data from event 
                        2 way binding concepts
                            [(ngModule)]   [()] --- AKA "banana in a box"
                            to use ngModule we need to import FormsModule in the app.module.ts file
